# Hello World
As the first step for Golang learning, a hello world application is expected.

The needed files for this project are a Dockerfile and a simple golang sample.

# How to run
You can build the application on local or either use docker to ease the process. Here, we will only cover the Dockerfile-through process.

Place yourself on the terminal, at the same level as this directory, and run:
```
docker build -t <simple project name> .
docker run <simple project name>
```
